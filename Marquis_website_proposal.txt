Proposal for Homeschool Co-op website

This website will serve as a hub for the homeschool co-op that my wife belongs to.  It will provide schedules, calendars, education content, and communication tools that parents can all use and participate in.

Desciption of Site

 - Homepage - Overview of the co-op, mission statement and welcome message
 - Calendar/Class Schedule - List of current and upcoming classes, events, and field trips
 - Resources - Learning materials, lesson plans, links to helpful resources
 - Member Directory - member / communication page
 - Registration page - Possible may or may not include this page.  Allows old and new members a way to donate and pay for needed fees
 - about us - List of administrators and place to contact leadership
 
Reason for Choosing

My wife is currently part of a homeschool co-op that is pretty new and they currently do not have a website to collaborate and organize all plans and events.  This will provide them with a way to organize their classes and events and provide communication of upcoming classes and events that is all in a central location.
